h1. What is SimpleConsole?

It's a tiny framework to get console applications developed quickly.  It might
be overkill scripts, but is pretty useful for some applications.

h1. How does it work?

SimpleConsole has a controller and a view, the controller sets up variables for
the view to present.  The view is optional, but is handy in the cases that you
have a lot of 'puts' methods and you want to separate them from your logic.

Here's an example, full working program:

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby -w
require 'rubygems'
require 'simpleconsole'

class Controller < SimpleConsole::Controller
  params :string => {:n => :name, :w => :word}

  def print
    @name = params[:name]
    @word = params[:word]
  end
end

class View < SimpleConsole::View
  def print
    puts "Your name is " + @name + "."
    puts "You wanted me to say the word " + @word + "."
  end
end

Application.run(ARGV, Controller, View)
</pre>

If this program were in the file 'myapp', you could use it on the command line
like this:

<pre class="code">
% myapp print --name Hugh -w Hello
Your name is Hugh.
You wanted me to say the word Hello.
</pre>
